Brackets for some reason only support these languages:
https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/language/languages.json
despite CodeMirror that Brackets use is supporting many more.
Fortunately, it's easy to add support for those through an extension:
https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Language-Support#defining-a-new-language

And that's what this extension is for.
